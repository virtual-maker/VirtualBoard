/*
  TimingWrapper.h - Part of the VirtualBoard project

  The VirtualBoard library allows editing, building and debugging Arduino sketches
  in Visual C++ and Visual Studio IDE. The library emulates standard Arduino libraries
  and connects them e.g. with the real serial ports and NIC of the computer.
  Optionally, real binary and analogue I/O pins as well as I2C and SPI interfaces
  can be controlled via an IO-Warrior device.
